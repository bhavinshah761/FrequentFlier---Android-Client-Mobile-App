# FrequentFlier---Android-Client-Mobile-App

This is a project that involves developing a Java server-side code to support a FrequentFlier application and building an Android mobile application to work with it. The goal is to create a simple but complete end-to-end database application following the 3-tier enterprise model.
1. The server-side code is comprised of one Java Servlet and seven Java Server Pages, and the Android client application project consists of a few activities for testing.
2. The project involves developing the JDBC code to implement the Java server-side components and creating the SQL queries needed in each server component. 
3. The Android client application project includes activities for testing the server-side components, such as logging in, retrieving passenger information, flights, flight details, award IDs, redemption details, and transfer points.
4. The server-side code responds to each request with the appropriate information, which is then parsed in the Android mobile app.
